# Multifeature-Linear-Regression
Implementation of Linear regression with more than one feature.

It may not work with other data points as according to other data points we need to adjust learning rate 
and also size of training and test data

There are two files above: MultifeatureLinearRegression and MultilinearRegressionWithNormaleq.

The 1st one uses gradient descent algorithm to solve for values of theta and the 2nd one uses normal eq instead of gradient descent which is faster way(for smaller no of rows in feature matrix).
